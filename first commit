Music Collection and Identifier

Objective: The purpose of my website is to create a platform where 
a music lover can get access to studio quality music, such as Spoitfy 
or Apple, but also access to amateur artists/music. If possible I would
also like to include a section where a user is able to identify the music 
via an artist or song.

Features: I would need to use several API's in order to get access to all
music data from several streaming services.
